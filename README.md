# EV-Management

## How to Run

Every application contains a README that explains how to run it. Please refer to the README file in each application directory for detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

The front end applications require the backend to be simultaneously running with the correct port.

## Details

I was asked to do task 1 and task 2a. Both these tasks were completed and all bonus points questions have been answered except for: "If you consider the impact of DST vs. mapping the hours to the 15 minute ticks".
Task 2b was optional but I still wanted to include a backend element to the task and added persistence of the inputs while I kept the output results a static JSON under `/frontend/src/data`.

- Task 1: `/backend/simulation`
- Task 2a: `/frontend`
- Task 2b: `/backend`
